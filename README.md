Hey there! 👋 I'm Mayank Yadav, a passionate full-stack web developer 🌐 with expertise in MERN stack technologies - MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. I love building web applications that are both visually appealing and functional, with a focus on creating a great user experience.

As a full-stack developer, I have experience in both front-end and back-end development. Whether it's building responsive UIs, implementing robust APIs, or setting up databases, I'm always up for a challenge.

Currently, I am pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering and will be graduating in 2024. I'm always eager to learn and stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and frameworks in the industry 🚀.
